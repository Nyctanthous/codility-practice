# codility-practice

My solutions to Codility's sample problems, as I get time to do them. Mostly here for my own benefit. All solutions were solved in the time constraints provided by Codility.

I've solved these problems in a "no hands barred" fashion; if I thought I could implement a faster solution than the suggested method did, I always opted for the faster one.

I assumed the following:

1. Waiting for space alocation when N is large is slower than log-linear sorting of the same large N.
